"""Tests for grid storage and loading operations.

Tests the recently added store_grid() and load_grid() functions
that persist GridData structures to Icechunk stores.

Tests cover:
- Storing equal-area grids
- Loading equal-area grids
- Round-trip integrity (store → load → compare)
- Storing HTM grids with vertex data
- Loading HTM grids with vertex reconstruction
- Metadata preservation
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Concurrent grid access from multiple sessions
