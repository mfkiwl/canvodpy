  "description": "canvodpy aims to be the central community-driven software suite for GNSS-Transmissometry (GNSS-T), providing the core ecosystem for deriving and analyzing canopy Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) from GNSS signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations. It provides modular packages for RINEX data reading, auxiliary data handling, hemispheric grid operations, Icechunk-based versioned storage, visualization, and VOD calculation algorithms, all tied together by Pydantic-validated configuration and a pipeline orchestrator.",
