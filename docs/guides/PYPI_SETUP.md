   - https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy

2. **Settings → Environments**

3. **New environment:**
   - Name: `test-release`
   - Click "Configure environment"

4. **Add protection rules (optional):**
   - Required reviewers: Add yourself
   - Wait timer: 0 minutes (it's just testing)

5. **Save**

### Step 5: Create TestPyPI Workflow

Create: `.github/workflows/publish_testpypi.yml`

```yaml
name: Publish to TestPyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

  # Manual trigger for testing
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  id-token: write  # REQUIRED for OIDC
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish-testpypi:
    name: Upload to TestPyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: test-release

    # Only run if tag contains 'beta' or 'alpha' (for testing)
    if: contains(github.ref, 'beta') || contains(github.ref, 'alpha')

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v7
        with:
          version: "0.9.27"

      - name: Set up Python
        run: uv python install 3.13

      - name: Build package
        run: uv build

      - name: Publish to TestPyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
          print-hash: true
```

### Step 6: Test the Workflow

**Create a beta release:**
```bash
just release 0.1.0-beta.1
git push origin main
git push origin --tags
```

**Publish the draft release:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy/releases
2. Find draft for `v0.1.0-beta.1`
3. Click "Publish release"

**Watch the workflow:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy/actions
2. See "Publish to TestPyPI" running
3. Wait ~2-3 minutes
4. Should say "✓ Complete"

**Verify upload:**
- https://test.pypi.org/project/canvodpy/
- Should see version 0.1.0b1

**Test installation:**
```bash
# Create test environment
uv venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate  # or test-env\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ canvodpy

# Test it works
python -c "import canvodpy; print(canvodpy.__version__)"
# Should print: 0.1.0b1

# Clean up
deactivate
rm -rf test-env
```

**If it works, you are ready for real PyPI.**

---

## Phase 2: Real PyPI Setup

### Step 7: Create Real PyPI Account

1. Go to: https://pypi.org/account/register/
2. Fill in details (can use same email as TestPyPI)
3. Verify email
4. **Enable 2FA** (PyPI requires it for trusted publishers!)

### Step 8: Reserve Package Name on PyPI

!!! warning "Package names are permanent"
    Once a package is uploaded to PyPI, the name is reserved forever.
    You cannot delete it or reuse its version numbers. Double-check everything before uploading.

```bash
# Build fresh
cd /path/to/canvodpy
rm -rf dist/
uv build

# Upload to REAL PyPI
uvx twine upload dist/*
```

**When prompted:**
```
username: your_pypi_username
password: your_pypi_password
```

**Verify:**
- https://pypi.org/project/canvodpy/

### Step 9: Configure OIDC on Real PyPI

**Exactly same as TestPyPI:**

1. **Go to:**
   - https://pypi.org/manage/project/canvodpy/settings/publishing/

2. **Add publisher:**
   ```
   PyPI project name:     canvodpy
   Owner:                 nfb2021
   Repository name:       canvodpy
   Workflow name:         publish_pypi.yml
   Environment name:      release
   ```

3. **Click "Add"**

### Step 10: Create Production GitHub Environment

!!! tip "Enable 2FA first"
    PyPI requires 2FA to add trusted publishers. Enable it at [pypi.org/manage/account/](https://pypi.org/manage/account/) before proceeding.

1. **Settings → Environments → New**
2. **Name:** `release`
3. **Protection rules (IMPORTANT!):**
   - Required reviewers: Add all maintainers
   - Wait timer: 5 minutes (think before publishing)
4. **Save**

### Step 11: Create Production Workflow

Create: `.github/workflows/publish_pypi.yml`

```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish-pypi:
    name: Upload to PyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: release

    # Skip beta/alpha releases for production PyPI
    if: "!contains(github.ref, 'beta') && !contains(github.ref, 'alpha')"

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v7
        with:
          version: "0.9.27"

      - name: Set up Python
        run: uv python install 3.13

      - name: Build package
        run: uv build

      - name: Check package
        run: |
          uvx twine check dist/*
          ls -lh dist/

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          print-hash: true
```

### Step 12: First Production Release

**When ready for v0.1.0:**

```bash
# Create release
just release 0.1.0
git push origin main
git push origin --tags
```

**Publish:**
1. Go to releases
2. Find draft v0.1.0
3. **Review carefully!**
4. Click "Publish release"
5. Approve the workflow when prompted
6. Wait 5 minutes (your wait timer)
7. Workflow runs
8. Package published to PyPI!

**Verify:**
```bash
pip install canvodpy
python -c "import canvodpy; print(canvodpy.__version__)"
# Should print: 0.1.0
```

**Your package is now on PyPI.**

## Summary

=== "Beta / test releases"

    ```bash
    just release 0.2.0-beta.1
    git push --tags
    # → publishes to TestPyPI automatically
    ```

=== "Stable releases"

    ```bash
    just release 0.2.0
    git push --tags
    # → publishes to real PyPI (after environment approval)
    ```

=== "User installation"

    ```bash
    pip install canvodpy          # latest stable
    pip install canvodpy==0.2.0   # specific version
    ```

---

## Best Practices

!!! tip "Test on TestPyPI first"
    Use `-beta.X` or `-alpha.X` version suffixes to publish to TestPyPI.
    Verify `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ canvodpy` works
    before creating a stable release.

!!! warning "Version numbers are permanent"
    PyPI does not allow deleting packages or reusing version numbers.
    Bump the version and re-release if you need to fix a bad upload.

!!! info "Environment protection"
    The `release` environment has required reviewers and a 5-minute wait timer —
    this prevents accidental production releases.

---

## Troubleshooting

??? failure "`Publisher not configured` OIDC error"
    1. Verify environment name in workflow matches PyPI config exactly
    2. Verify workflow filename matches exactly
    3. Verify repository owner/name are correct
    4. Confirm 2FA is enabled on your PyPI account

??? failure "`Package already exists`"
    Cannot upload the same version twice. Bump and retry:
    ```bash
    just bump patch   # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
    ```

??? failure "`Build failed`"
    Test locally first:
    ```bash
    uv build
    ls dist/   # should contain .whl and .tar.gz
    uvx twine check dist/*
    ```

??? failure "Environment approval stuck"
    Check the `release` environment's protection rules at
    Settings → Environments → release. Approve pending deployments manually.
