I need to add modern python type hints to my code, appropriate for 2026. And
 docstrings, using numpy style. Some exisitng docstring may need to be
 adapted, many new will have to be created. I have an 88 character line length
 limit. The purpose is to helo me polish my scietific python package, so that
 it is as informative as possible to the user when they a) look at the source
 code and b) hover over classes/funtions/… in their IDE. My preferred IDE is
 VSCode. Always ask before adding code. Never never never change logic or
 anything else in the code base without consulting with me first
